"""

In Python, the following types are mutable:

Lists
Dictionaries
Sets
Byte arrays
User-defined classes (if they are designed to be mutable)


The following types are immutable:

Strings
Integers
Floats
Booleans
Tuples
Frozensets

It's important to note that while these are the general rule, some operations on immutable objects may return a new object, rather than modifying the existing one. 
For example, when you use slicing or concatenation on strings, a new string object is returned, rather than modifying the original string.
