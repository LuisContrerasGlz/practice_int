# Program to find the duplicate characters in String.

"""

Approach:

Iterate Through String:

Traverse each character in the given string.
Counting Occurrences:

For each character, maintain a count of its occurrences.
Identify Duplicates:

If the count of a character is more than 1, mark it as a duplicate.
Output:

Display or store the duplicate characters.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "programming"
Identify duplicate characters:

Duplicates: 'g', 'r', 'm'
Note:

Decide whether the comparison is case-sensitive or not.
Ensure that duplicates are identified correctly, considering their frequency.
