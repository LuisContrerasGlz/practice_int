# Program to convert the first letter of each word in a string to uppercase.

"""

Approach:

Split the String:

Break down the input string into individual words. This involves separating the string based on spaces or other delimiters.
Uppercase Transformation:

For each word obtained, transform the first letter to uppercase.
Reassemble the String:

Combine the modified words to form the final string.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "hello world"
Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase:

Output String: "Hello World"
Note:

Handle cases where the input string might have different word separators.
Ensure that the transformation is applied only to the first letter of each word.
