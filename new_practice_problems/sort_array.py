# Program to sort an array

"""

Approach:

Select a Sorting Algorithm:

Choose a sorting algorithm based on the requirements and constraints.
Implement the Chosen Algorithm:

Implement the selected sorting algorithm in the code.
Apply the Sorting Algorithm to the Array:

Use the implemented algorithm to sort the elements of the array.
Result:

The array is now sorted in ascending order.
Common Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort: Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. Repeat until no swaps are needed.
Selection Sort: Select the smallest element and swap it with the first element. Repeat for the remaining unsorted portion.
Insertion Sort: Build the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking an element and inserting it into its correct position.
Merge Sort: Divide the array into two halves, recursively sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves.
Quick Sort: Choose a "pivot" element, partition the array into two sub-arrays based on the pivot, and recursively sort the sub-arrays.
Example:
Let's take an example using the Selection Sort algorithm:

Input Array: [5, 3, 9, 1, 7, 2]
Sort the array:

Resulting Array: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Note:

The choice of sorting algorithm may depend on factors such as the size of the array, time complexity requirements, and stability.
