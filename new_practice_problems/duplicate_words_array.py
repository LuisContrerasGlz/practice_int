# Program to Find Duplicate Words in a Given String

"""

Approach:

Tokenization:

Split the input string into individual words. This may involve using spaces or other delimiters.
Counting Occurrences:

For each word, maintain a count of its occurrences.
Identify Duplicates:

If the count of a word is more than 1, mark it as a duplicate.
Output:

Display or store the duplicate words.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "This is a programming is a language programming."
Identify duplicate words:

Duplicates: 'is', 'a', 'programming'
Note:

Decide whether the comparison is case-sensitive or not.
Handle punctuation marks and other special characters appropriately.
