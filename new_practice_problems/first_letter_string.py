# Print first letter of each word present in string

"""


Approach:

Tokenization:

Split the input string into individual words. This involves separating the string based on spaces or other delimiters.
Print First Letter:

For each word obtained, print the first letter.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "hello world"
Print the first letter of each word:

Output: "h w"
Note:

Ensure that the output format is as desired, considering spacing or other requirements.
Handle situations where words may be separated by different delimiters.
