# Program to find first non-repeated character from string.

"""

Approach:

Character Count:

Count the occurrences of each character in the string.
Find First Non-Repeated:

Iterate through the string and check the count of each character.
The first character with a count of 1 is the first non-repeated character.
Result:

Return the first non-repeated character found.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "programming"
Find the first non-repeated character:

Result: 'o'
Note:

If no non-repeated character is found, return an appropriate indicator (e.g., 'None' or a special character).
Decide whether the comparison is case-sensitive or not.
