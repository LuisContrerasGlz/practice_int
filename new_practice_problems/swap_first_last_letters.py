# Program to swap the first and last letter in a string.

"""

Approach:

Check String Length:

Verify that the length of the string is at least 2 (to ensure there are both a first and last letter to swap).
Swap Letters:

Swap the characters at the first and last positions in the string.
Result:

The modified string after swapping is the result.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "programming"
Swap the first and last letter:

Result: "grogramminp"

Note:

Handle situations where the string is empty or has only one character.
The solution works for strings of any length greater than or equal to 2.
