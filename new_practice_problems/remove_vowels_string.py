# Program to remove vowels from a String

"""

Approach:

Initialize Result String:

Create an empty string to store the result without vowels.
Iterate Through String:

Traverse each character in the given string.
Check for Vowels:

For each character, check if it is a vowel.
If it's not a vowel, add it to the result string.
Result:

The result string now contains the input string with vowels removed.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "programming"
Remove vowels:

Result: "prgrmmng"
Note:

Decide whether the comparison is case-sensitive or not.
Consider whether you want to remove both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
