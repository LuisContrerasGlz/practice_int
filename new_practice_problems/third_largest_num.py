# Program to find Third Largest Number in an Array

"""

Approach:

Initialize Variables:

Assume the first three elements of the array as the first, second, and third largest.
Iterate Through Array:

Traverse each element in the array.
Update Largest Numbers:

For each element, compare it with the current first, second, and third largest numbers.
Update the variables accordingly.
Result:

The third largest number found during the iteration is the result.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input Array: [5, 3, 9, 1, 7, 2]
Find the third largest number:

Result: 3

Note:

Handle situations where the array may have fewer than three unique elements.
If duplicates exist, the third largest unique number is usually considered.
