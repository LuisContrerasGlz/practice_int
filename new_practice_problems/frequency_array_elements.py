# Count the frequency of elements in an array.


"""

Approach:

Initialize Frequency Count:

Create a data structure (such as a dictionary or an array) to store the frequency count of each unique element.
Iterate Through Array:

Traverse each element in the array.
Count Frequency:

For each element, update its frequency count in the data structure.
Result:

The data structure now contains the frequency of each unique element in the array.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Array: [2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 7, 6]
Count the frequency of each element:

Frequency Count: {2: 2, 3: 2, 5: 1, 6: 2, 4: 1, 7: 1}
Note:

Ensure that the data structure used for counting is suitable for the task.
Handle situations where the array may be empty.
