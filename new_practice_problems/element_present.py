# Program to check if an element present in the array or not.

"""

Approach:

Iterate Through the Array:

Traverse each element in the array.
Comparison:

For each element, compare it with the target element to check for a match.
Result:

If a match is found, the element is present in the array.
If no match is found after checking all elements, the element is not present.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Array: [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
Element to check: 7
Check if 7 is present in the array:

Result: Yes, 7 is present in the array.
Note:

Decide whether the comparison is case-sensitive or not.
Handle situations where the element may appear more than once in the array.
