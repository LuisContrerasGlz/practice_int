# Program to count the occurrences of a particular character in a String

"""

Approach:

Iterate Through the String:

Traverse each character in the given string.
Counting:

Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of occurrences of the specified character.
Comparison:

Check each character against the specified character.
If the character matches, increment the counter.
Example:
Let's take an example:

String: "programming"
Character to count: 'g'
Count the occurrences:

String: "programming"
Character to count: 'g'
Occurrences of 'g': 2

Note:

Ensure that the comparison is case-sensitive unless specified otherwise.
Handle the situation where the specified character may not be present in the string.
