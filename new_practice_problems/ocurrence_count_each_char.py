# Program to Count the Occurrences of Each Character

"""

Approach:

Initialize Character Count:

Create a data structure (such as a dictionary or an array) to store the frequency count of each character.
Iterate Through String:

Traverse each character in the given string.
Count Occurrences:

For each character, update its frequency count in the data structure.
Result:

The data structure now contains the count of occurrences for each character.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "programming"
Count the occurrences of each character:

Character Count: {'p': 1, 'r': 2, 'o': 1, 'g': 2, 'a': 1, 'm': 2, 'i': 1, 'n': 1}
Note:

Decide whether the comparison is case-sensitive or not.
Punctuation marks and spaces may or may not be considered, depending on the requirements.
