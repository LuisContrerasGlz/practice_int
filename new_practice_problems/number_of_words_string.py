# Count the number of words in given string.


"""

Approach:

Tokenization:

Split the input string into individual words. This involves separating the string based on spaces or other delimiters.
Counting:

Count the number of words obtained after tokenization.
Result:

The count of words is the result.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "Hello, how are you doing?"
Count the number of words:

Result: 6 (Hello, how, are, you, doing)
Note:

Handle situations where there may be consecutive spaces or other delimiters.
Punctuation marks may or may not be considered as part of a word, depending on the requirements.
