# Merge two sorted arrays.

"""

Approach:

Initialize Pointers:

Use two pointers, one for each array, to keep track of the current position.
Compare and Merge:

Compare the elements at the current positions in both arrays.
Add the smaller (or equal) element to the merged array and move the pointer in that array.
Handle Remaining Elements:

Continue comparing and merging until one of the arrays is exhausted.
If any elements remain in the non-empty array, add them to the merged array.
Result:

The merged array is the result, and it is also sorted.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Array 1: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Array 2: [2, 4, 6, 8]
Merge the two arrays:

Merged Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Note:

This approach takes advantage of the fact that the input arrays are already sorted.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the merged array.
