# Count the number of vowels in the given String


"""

Approach:

Iterate Through the String:

Traverse each character in the given string.
Check for Vowels:

For each character, check if it is a vowel (either uppercase or lowercase).
Counting:

Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of vowels encountered.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "programming"
Count the number of vowels:

Input String: "programming"
Number of vowels: 3 (o, o, i)

Note:

Decide whether the comparison is case-sensitive or not.
Include both uppercase and lowercase vowels in the check.
