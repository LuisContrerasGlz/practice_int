# Program to check if all elements in a List are unique.


"""

Approach:

Use a Data Structure:

Choose a suitable data structure to keep track of unique elements encountered.
Iterate Through List:

Traverse each element in the list.
Check for Uniqueness:

For each element, check whether it has been encountered before.
If it's a new element, add it to the data structure.
If it's a duplicate, the list does not have all unique elements.
Result:

If the iteration completes without finding any duplicates, the list has all unique elements.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input List: [5, 3, 9, 1, 7, 2]
Check if all elements are unique:

Result: Yes, all elements are unique.

Note:

The choice of data structure may vary depending on the specific requirements.
The time complexity of this solution is typically O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
