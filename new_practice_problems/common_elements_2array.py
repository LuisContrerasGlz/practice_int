# Program to Find Common Elements Between Two Arrays.

"""

Approach:

Iterate Through Arrays:

Traverse each element in the first array.
Comparison:

For each element in the first array, compare it with each element in the second array.
Identify Common Elements:

If an element is found in both arrays, mark it as a common element.
Output:

Display or store the common elements.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Array 1: [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
Array 2: [5, 9, 12, 15]
Identify common elements:

Common elements: [5, 9]
Note:

The order of common elements may or may not be preserved, depending on the specific requirements.
Ensure that duplicates are handled appropriately.
