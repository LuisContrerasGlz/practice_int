# Program to find the smallest number in an array.

"""

Approach:

Initialize Minimum:

Assume the first element of the array as the minimum.
Iterate Through Array:

Traverse each element in the array.
Update Minimum:

For each element, compare it with the current minimum.
If the element is smaller, update the minimum.
Result:

The minimum value found during the iteration is the result.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input Array: [5, 3, 9, 1, 7, 2]
Find the smallest number:

Result: 1

Note:

Handle situations where the array may be empty.
If duplicates exist, the first occurrence of the smallest number is usually considered.
