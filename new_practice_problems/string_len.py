# Program to find the length of String without using length() method

"""

Approach:

Iterate Through Characters:

Use a loop to traverse each character in the string.
Count Characters:

Maintain a counter to count the number of characters encountered during the iteration.
Result:

The counter value is the length of the string.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "programming"
Find the length of the string without using length() method:

Result: 11

Note:

This approach provides an alternative way to determine the length of a string.
Handle situations where the string may be empty.
