# Extract Last 4 characters of any String

"""

Approach:

Check String Length:

Verify that the length of the string is at least 4.
Substring Extraction:

Use substring operations to extract the last 4 characters of the string.
Result:

Return the extracted substring.
Example:
Let's take an example:

Input String: "programming"
Extract the last 4 characters:

Result: "ming"
Note:

If the string is less than 4 characters, handle it appropriately (e.g., return the whole string or a special indicator).
The approach is generic and works for strings of any length.
