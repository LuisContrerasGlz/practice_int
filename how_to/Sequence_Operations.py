Common sequence operations

len(sequence) -             Returns the length of the sequence

for element in sequence -   Iterates over each element in the sequence

if element in sequence -    Checks whether the element is part of the sequence

sequence[i] -               Accesses the element at index i of the sequence, starting at zero

sequence[i:j] -             Accesses a slice starting at index i, ending at index j-1. If i is omitted, it's 0 by default. If j is omitted, it's len(sequence) by default.

for index, element in enumerate(sequence) - Iterates over both the indexes and the elements in the sequence at the same time
