All extensions for Gherkin are .feature 

Gherkin specifications are typically written in plain text and follow a specific syntax. Some key elements of the Gherkin language include:

    Feature: A Gherkin file typically starts with a "Feature" section, which describes a high-level feature or functionality of the software.

    Scenario: Under the "Feature" section, one or more "Scenarios" are defined. 
    
              Each scenario represents a specific test case and describes a particular behavior or condition of the software.

    Given-When-Then: Scenarios are structured using the "Given-When-Then" format, which outlines the context, action, and expected outcome of the scenario. For example:

        "Given" represents the initial state or context.
        "When" describes the action or event.
        "Then" specifies the expected outcome.

    Background: A "Background" section can be used to define common steps that are shared across multiple scenarios, reducing duplication.

    Examples: The "Examples" section can be used for data-driven testing, providing different sets of input data for a scenario to be tested with.
