/*

 This Java code includes two methods: testAssert and testVerify.
testAssert uses the assert statement to perform an assertion. 
If the assertion fails, it throws an AssertionError and stops the execution immediately.

testVerify demonstrates a "verify"-like behavior using a try-catch block.
It checks a condition and, if the condition is not met, throws an AssertionError.
However, it catches the error and allows the test to continue running.
